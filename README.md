# Ram√≥n Peralta Mart√≠nez ‚Äî Data Scientist | Biologist | PhD

Hi! I'm Ram√≥n ‚Äî a Biologist and PhD candidate in Biochemistry at Fundaci√≥n Instituto Leloir - CONICET (thesis written, defense pending). I‚Äôm passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights using machine learning and data modeling.

With a background in scientific research and analytical thinking, I‚Äôve transitioned into Data Science, where I apply ML and DL techniques to solve real-world problems. I‚Äôm currently working on freelance projects involving customer segmentation and agricultural data, building end-to-end solutions from data pipelines to web applications.

## **Check out some of my public projects!**

1. **Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning**  
   **Description:** In this project, I applied an unsupervised K-means model to group customers of a company into different segments based on their purchasing patterns.  
   Repository: https://github.com/ramonpm4/Proyectos/blob/main/Proyecto_de_Segmentacion_de_Clientes.ipynb

2. **Risk Classification of Cardiovascular Disease Using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
   **Description:** I developed a supervised classification model to predict with an accuracy of 89.7% the probability of a patient having a cardiovascular disease based on eleven patient-specific features. I then deployed the model using Streamlit so that users could access the trained model and learn about the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
