# **RamÃ³n Peralta Martinez - Data Science | PhD Candidate**

Hello there! I'm RamÃ³n, a Biologist and PhD candidate in Biochemistry at the FundaciÃ³n Instituto Leloir - CONICET. I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills in Data Science within a company.

## **About Me**

- ðŸŽ“ **Education**: Biology (Bachelor's, UBA) and Biochemical Chemistry (PhD - near completition).
- ðŸ“Š **Data Science**: Experience in data analysis and data modeling using Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib), with a strong interest in machine learning.
- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning**: I've worked with unsupervised (clustering) and supervised models. I am very interested in fine tune my ML skills with a continuous lerning mindset. Additionally, I am knowledgeable about the operation and application of Deep Learning models.
- ðŸ’» **Tools**: Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Knowledge in SQL and Cloud Computing (Azure)


## **Featured Projects:**

1. **Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning**  
   **Description:** In this project, I applied an unsupervised K-means model to group customers of a company into different segments based on their purchasing patterns.  
   Repository: [[Customer Segmentation](#)](https://github.com/ramonpm4/Proyectos/blob/main/Proyecto_de_Segmentacion_de_Clientes.ipynb)

2. **Risk Classification of Cardiovascular Disease Using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
   **Description:** I developed a supervised classification model to predict with an accuracy of 89.7% the probability of a patient having a cardiovascular disease based on eleven patient-specific features. I then deployed the model using Streamlit so that users could access the trained model and learn about the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
