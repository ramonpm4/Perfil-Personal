# **RamÃ³n Peralta Martinez - Data Scientist | PhD Candidate**

Hello there! I'm RamÃ³n, a Biologist and PhD candidate in Biochemistry at the FundaciÃ³n Instituto Leloir - CONICET. I specialize in turning complex data into actionable insights through machine learning and data modeling.

With a strong foundation in analytical thinking and scientific research, Iâ€™ve transitioned into the world of Data Science, applying ML and DL techniques to solve real-world problems. Iâ€™m currently working on freelance projects in customer segmentation and agricultural data analysis, building everything from machine learning pipelines to full-stack data apps with Streamlit and MySQL

##  Skills

- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pytest, Streamlit), R  
- **Data Mining:** Data cleaning, EDA, data modelling, model evaluation  
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised (Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Ensembles), Unsupervised (Clustering â€“ KMeans, Anomaly Detection)  
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks, hyperparameter tuning  
- **Statistical Modeling:** General Linear Models, Generalized Linear Models  
- **Databases & Cloud:** SQL, Azure Cloud Computing  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Tableau  
- **Languages:** Spanish (Native), English (Professional), German (A1)  
- **Mindset & Communication:** Problem-solving mindset, continuous learner, effective communicator, collaborative approach  


## **Featured Public Projects:**

1. **Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning**  
   **Description:** In this project, I applied an unsupervised K-means model to group customers of a company into different segments based on their purchasing patterns.

2. **Risk Classification of Cardiovascular Disease Using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
   **Description:** I developed a supervised classification model to predict with an accuracy of 89.7% the probability of a patient having a cardiovascular disease based on eleven patient-specific features. I then deployed the model using Streamlit so that users could access the trained model and learn about the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.
