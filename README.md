# Ramón Peralta Martínez — Python Backend & Data

With 5+ years in data-driven projects and research, I’m proficient in building Python backends with a solid foundation in SQL, testing, and ETL. I’m migrating an agronomy platform I built from Streamlit to Django while strengthening DevOps (Docker, CI/CD) and cloud skills. PhD in Biochemistry (thesis written; defense pending). Eager to keep growing as a Python developer in production-focused teams.

- **Programming:** Python (**Django**, **FastAPI**, **pytest**, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow basics); HTML and CSS (basics) 
- **Databases & Data:** **SQL** (MySQL/PostgreSQL), schema design, optimization; ETL & data validation  
- **DevOps & Cloud:** **Docker**, Git/GitHub, **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**; Linux/macOS; AWS/Azure (basics)  
- **Machine Learning:** Supervised/Unsupervised (regression, trees/ensembles, **K-Means**); model evaluation  
- **Visualization:** Streamlit, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Power BI, Tableau  
- **Languages:** Spanish (Native), English (Professional), German (A1)

## **Check out some of my public projects!**

1. **Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning**  
   **Description:** In this project, I applied an unsupervised K-means model to group customers of a company into different segments based on their purchasing patterns.

2. **Risk Classification of Cardiovascular Disease Using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost**  
   **Description:** I developed a supervised classification model to predict with an accuracy of 89.7% the probability of a patient having a cardiovascular disease based on eleven patient-specific features. I then deployed the model using Streamlit so that users could access the trained model and learn about the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

3. **Lead Scoring with Interpretable Machine Learning: Comparing EBM and XGBoost with SHAP Explanations**
**Description:** In this project, I built a lead scoring model using two complementary approaches: a black-box XGBoost model interpreted with SHAP, and a fully interpretable Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM). The goal was not only to predict the probability of conversion but also to extract actionable insights for marketing strategy based on feature-level analysis.

4. **Churn Rate Dashboard**
**Description:** Analyzed churn behavior in relation to pricing strategy. Found that high monthly charges increased churn for new users, while long-term users showed higher retention. Recommended onboarding clients at lower prices and gradually increasing rates, along with incentives for yearly contracts to improve ROI.

5. **Time Series Forecasting with RNN, LSTM, and Holt-Winters**
**Description:** Analyzed a univariate time series with trend and yearly seasonality. Built a Holt-Winters baseline and recurrent neural models (Simple RNN and LSTM) for one-step and multi-step (recursive) forecasting. Pipeline included log and log-diff transforms, scaling, sliding windows, and walk-forward backtesting. Findings: LSTM delivered the best one-step accuracy; Holt-Winters outperformed for longer multi-step horizons; the log+diff transform improved stationarity and training stability.

6. **A/B Test — Auto-response with Logistic GLM**
**Description:** Evaluated whether a new auto-response model increases the augmentation_rate (% of agent messages sent via suggestions) using 46,195 conversations. To reduce allocation bias, the analysis was restricted to November when both variants ran concurrently (43% treatment / 57% control). Built a binomial GLM (logit) at the conversation level (augmented vs. total messages), controlling for conversation length and time of day, with cluster-robust (HC3) standard errors to address intra-conversation correlation. Findings: Treatment coefficient ln(OR) = −0.0173 (OR ≈ 0.983) with a 95% CI overlapping 0, indicating no statistically significant lift in augmentation.
